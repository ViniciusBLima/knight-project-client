## Overview

The Knight-Project is a web application designed to organize and manage a registry of knights. This Vue.js version provides a dynamic and interactive user interface, enabling users to create, view, modify, and delete entries of knights with ease. It also includes features such as filtering knights and highlighting those who have achieved hero status.
